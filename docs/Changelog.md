Date: 2026-03-03

- Added type filter select and per-entry info buttons to `/evolve list`.
- Reduced page size and filter options to fit Discord component limits.
- Made expired evolve views keep UI disabled instead of hiding controls.

## v1.9.1 — Release notes and version bump

Date: 2026-03-02

- Added v1.9.0 release notes documenting recent bug fixes and features.

Date: 2026-02-27

- Initial project scaffold and first commit (6f75204).

## v0.2.0 — Core utilities, DB and command scaffolding

Date: 2026-02-27

- Refactored database access into a unified `db` module and improved DATABASE_URL handling for MySQL/Postgres (4717292, adef985).
- Removed local SQLite binary from repository and updated .gitignore (dcac588).
- Added `checkcommands` utility and enhanced command loading/logging (93c061e, efde13f).
- Fixed various spawn/knex/interaction reference bugs discovered during initial integration (9d040f7, 9ef0ad8, e40b4d4).

## v0.3.0 — Commands, setup and autocomplete

Date: 2026-02-27 — 2026-02-28

- Hardened logging and sanitization: added redaction for sensitive env values in health and log-tail outputs, file-backed `fallbackLogger`, and forced-ANSI support for consistent logs in non-TTY environments.
- `/health` redesign: switched to subcommands (`show` and `lastlogs`), added developer `detail` levels, owner-only `lastlogs` with rate-limiting and audit entries, and masked secrets as `*****` in outputs.
- Collector helper and command hardening: centralized `createInteractionCollector`, fixed many collector integrations across commands to avoid component attach errors.
- `/info` styling and runtime values: `info` now reports real runtime values (Node, discord.js, gateway ping, shard info, cached counts) and includes thumbnail/footer/timestamp for clarity.
- `/stats` overhaul: reorganized layout, combined server/global views, added SQL-backed leaderboard ranking via `egg_catches`, and per-egg historical rates computed from recorded events.
- Egg recording and analytics: added `egg_catches` table and `recordEggCatch()` to persist timestamped catch events and keep aggregate `egg_stats` in sync.
- Spawn loop fix: ensured the spawn manager always schedules the next spawn after events complete to avoid the loop stopping unexpectedly.
- Various small fixes and compatibility updates across commands, configuration, and deploy flows.

## v1.2.0 — News, Shop, Inventory, and Currency Improvements

Released: 2026-02-28

This release introduces multiple user-facing features, bug fixes, and developer tools. Highlights:

### Key Features

- News/Home improvements
  - The news home now automatically previews the most recent article (uses file modification timestamps to detect newest content).
  - Added `src/utils/articles.js` to reliably detect latest article title/content with short caching.
  - When a user opens `/news` the bot records the latest article timestamp as read for that user so reminders stop.
  - Added a per-user unread-article reminder that shows on commands when a newer article is available; reminders are cleared when the user reads the article.

- Inventory UI & Currencies
  - Added a `Currencies` tab to `Inventory` showing `credits` (global) and `royal_jelly` (guild).
  - Fixed an issue where the inventory view showed an "Avatar / View Avatar" placeholder when the user had no items — avatar only appears when items exist.
  - `credits` is now a global currency stored under `data.currency.credits` (not per-guild). Default value is `0` via `config/userDefaults.json`.

- Shop & Items
  - Shop UI now displays configured emojis and uses a stable button implementation compatible with the repo's discord.js/builders versions.
  - Removed purchasable eggs/cosmetics from the shop and added consumable items and boosts.
  - Fixed buy flow robustness and purchase confirmation messaging; purchases correctly deduct currency and add items.

- Developer & Ops
  - Added several developer-only commands and hid them from normal help listings.
  - Hardened `deveval` with blacklists and logging.
  - Added owner bypasses for setup and text-mode `forcespawn` commands.

- Data & Migrations
  - Made `credits` a global currency: added `scripts/migrate-credits-global.js` to migrate guild-level credits to global credits (dry-run and apply modes).
  - Added `scripts/migrate-mark-articles-read.js` to initialize `data.meta.lastReadArticleAt` for existing users so they won't immediately see unread reminders.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a TypeError related to `ButtonBuilder` incompatibilities by using the builders-provided `SecondaryButtonBuilder`/`SuccessButtonBuilder` fallback when appropriate.
- Fixed interaction handling so the news-reminder check is performed asynchronously and does not block command handling (avoids "The application did not respond").
- Adjusted inventory and shop collectors to be robust against rejected component payloads.

### Notes for Server Operators

- Run `node scripts/migrate-credits-global.js --apply` if you have legacy `credits` stored per-guild and want them consolidated into global balances.
- A one-time migration to mark all users as read was included and run during development. If you prefer a different initial state, run `node scripts/migrate-mark-articles-read.js` (dry-run without `--apply`).

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.2.0`.
- Tests run locally and passed after changes.

## v1.3.0 — Help UX, embed colour unification, spawn deletion toggle

Date: 2026-02-28

- Added a guild-level toggle to delete the original spawn message after it is caught (`/setup message-delete enabled:<true|false>`). The setting is persisted under `guild_settings.data.delete_spawn_message` and defaults to `false` in `config/guildDefaults.json`.
- Implemented spawn-message deletion in the spawn manager with robust channel/message fetch and a `Manage Messages` permission check. Failures are logged but do not surface user-facing errors.
- Unified embed colour across commands: added a top-level `colour` in `config/commands.json`, normalized color strings to numeric values in the commands loader, and fixed EmbedBuilder ValidationErrors by using numeric fallbacks.
- Improved Help UX: added "About" and "Setup (Server Admins)" sections, removed the `usage` display (and removed `usage` fields from the commands config), fixed category listing and selection bugs, and restored clickable setup mentions where application command IDs are available.
- Added a developer-only `devgive` command and registered it for owner use.
- Migrated many commands to a per-command directory layout while keeping legacy files to preserve history and ease rollout.
- Logging and diagnostics: event/load logs now include event names, spawn/hatch logs include `guildName` when available, and fallback logging was hardened for edge cases.
- Fixed several runtime and syntax issues introduced during refactors (help selection population, truncated help file syntax, and embed color validation).

Notes:

- The spawn deletion feature defaults to off; enable via `/setup message-delete enabled:true` to start deleting spawn messages after a catch.
- Additional followups: add an admin-facing notice when the bot lacks `Manage Messages` permission in the spawn channel, and consider de-duplicating legacy flat command files in a future cleanup release.

## v1.4.0 — DevMenu, logging improvements, and leaderboard fixes

Date: 2026-03-02

### Key Features

- **DevMenu command**: Converted `xen!devcommands` to a new `xen!devmenu` interactive command with owner-only action buttons for developer maintenance.
- **Enhanced logging with guild context**: Added guild names to spawn and hatch manager logs.
- **Eggs command options registration**: Fixed missing option definitions in `config/commands.json`.
- **Leaderboard server filtering fix**: Fixed `/leaderboard server` showing global data.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed several collector and logging issues.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.4.0`.

## v1.5.0 — V2 Components stabilization and nodemon improvements

Date: 2026-03-02

### Key Features

- **V2 Components Migration**: Completed migration of `/news` command to discord.js V2 components using ContainerBuilder, TextDisplayBuilder, and SeparatorBuilder for modern UI rendering.
- **Improved Collector Helper**: Enhanced `createInteractionCollector` to properly handle V2 component updates and avoid sending empty messages:
  - Now intelligently filters out empty arrays for components and embeds
  - Prevents Discord API errors (50006: Cannot send an empty message)
  - Properly passes MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2 for V2 component rendering

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed ButtonBuilder import errors by using style-specific builders (PrimaryButtonBuilder, SecondaryButtonBuilder) compatible with discord.js v15
- Fixed V2 component update pattern: changed from `message.edit()` to `btn.editReply()` for proper interaction-based updates
- Fixed collectorHelper passing undefined properties to Discord API, which now filters to only include defined and non-empty values
- Fixed news command home view to skip loading latest article preview when none exist
- Fixed nodemon auto-restart on gitignored files (logs, .env, data)

### Developer Experience

- Added comprehensive `nodemon.json` configuration that ignores log files, data, and editor files
- Updated `npm run dev` to use nodemon config instead of inline flags
- Prevents unnecessary bot restarts when logging systems write to disk

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.5.0`.
- All V2 component patterns now follow discord.js v15 best practices
- Bot remains stable during development workflows with proper file watching

## v1.6.0 — Eggs List Overhaul & Rarity System

Date: 2026-03-02

### Major Features

- **Complete Eggs List Redesign**: Transformed `/eggs list` into a fully interactive command matching hunt-list functionality:
  - Paginated display (4 hatches per page)
  - Direct collection from list with disabled button states
  - Shows collected eggs with "Collected: ✅" status and disabled buttons
  - Added Statistics page showing total hatches, ready count, most common type, and unique types
  - Added interactive "Hatch Egg" button with dropdown selection menu
  - Navigation between list, stats, and hatch screens
  - Improved timestamp display: "Hatched: \<time\>" / "Hatching: \<time\>" / "Collected: ✅"

- **Configurable Rarity System**: Created centralized rarity configuration:
  - New `config/rarities.json` defining rarity tiers (Common 1-3, Rare 4-5, Very Rare 6+)
  - Added custom rarity emojis: `<:common:...>`, `<:rare:...>`, `<:very_rare:...>`
  - Updated both eggs list and hunt-list to display emoji-only rarity badges
  - Unified display format: `🥚 Egg Name • :very_rare:` instead of `🥚 Egg Name • 🟪 Very Rare`

- **Enhanced Egg Hatching UX**:
  - Removed `/eggs collect` subcommand (collection now happens directly from list)
  - Added select menu for hatching with dropdown showing available eggs, quantities, and hatch times
  - Added "View List" button to all result pages (sell/hatch) with full interactive navigation
  - Result pages now have complete collector support for seamless workflow

### Display Improvements

- **Unified format across eggs and hunt-list**:
  - Three-line display: Name/Type • Rarity, ID: ###, Status/Timestamp
  - Consistent emoji usage and rarity badge placement
  - Bot avatar thumbnails on all list pages

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed egg list showing all hatches including collected ones inappropriately
- Fixed button states not properly disabling when eggs aren't ready to collect
- Fixed navigation between different screens losing context
- Improved collector lifecycle management for sell/hatch commands

### Configuration Changes

- Added `config/rarities.json` with rarity tier definitions

- Improved code maintainability with modular page builders

## v1.7.0 — Pathways, Devgive expansion, number formatting, and support links

Date: 2026-03-02

### Key Features

- **Pathway command registration fix**: Fixed `/pathway` not appearing by restoring proper command `data` export so it deploys and registers correctly.
- **Evolution pathway stage corrections**: Updated egg first-stage mapping so pathways hatch into lore-appropriate starts:
  - Neomorph eggs now hatch to `bloodburster`
  - Deacon-path eggs now hatch to `hammerpede`
  - King-path eggs now hatch to `king_facehugger`
- **Devgive expansion and UX cleanup**:
  - Added ability to grant `xenomorphs` at specific pathway/stage
  - Added ability to grant `royal_jelly`
  - Consolidated `/devgive` into a single unified flow with a `type` selector and contextual autocomplete
- **New public utility commands**:
  - Added `/invite` to provide bot OAuth invite link
  - Added `/support-server` to provide support Discord link

### Improvements

- **Readable number formatting system**:
  - Added `src/utils/numberFormat.js` (`formatNumber`, `formatNumberShort`, `formatNumberAuto`)
  - Applied formatting across key surfaces (including `devgive`, `stats`, `inventory`, `eggs`, and hive displays) so large values are shown as comma-separated or compact forms.
- **Error-response support routing**:
  - Interaction failure replies now include a support-server link when configured.
  - Added support invite and bot invite URLs in `config/links.json`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `ButtonBuilder is not a constructor` runtime errors affecting `/invite`, `/support-server`, and fallback interaction error replies by using compatibility-safe link button payloads.
- Prevented secondary error-reply failures in interaction error handling path.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.7.0`.
- Updated release documentation to include all post-`1.6.0` shipped changes.

## v1.8.0 — Gift fix, ephemeral interactions, and critical memory leak patch

Date: 2026-03-02

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Memory leak patch**: Fixed critical memory leak affecting message component collectors across 9 commands (hunt, hunt-list, ping, hive, evolve, emojis, pathway, help, and gift).
  - Root cause: Removed collector `filter` functions were replaced with manual user ID checks inside collect handlers, causing all interactions from all users to be processed instead of filtered at collector creation time.
  - Impact: Memory accumulation from 224 MB → 1473 MB before OOM crash on deployed bot.
  - Solution: Restored proper `filter: i => i.user.id === userId` to all affected collectors to prevent processing unwanted interactions and eliminate unbounded memory growth.
  - All 9 commands validated and tested; collectors now properly filter interactions at creation time.

### Features

- **Gift command SQL fix**: Fixed `/gift xenomorph` error when users had active evolution queue jobs.
  - Changed `xenomorph_id` to `xeno_id` in evolution_queue table query (line 367) to match actual schema.
- **Devephemeral command**: Added developer-only text command `/devephemeral` for testing Components v2 ephemeral interaction responses.
  - Text-only execution (no slash command data export).
  - Demonstrates proper ContainerBuilder and TextDisplayBuilder usage with MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2.

### UX Improvements

- **Ephemeral help interactions**: Fixed `/help` command to properly display as ephemeral when appropriate.
  - Added missing `ephemeral: isEphemeral` flag to deferReply and safeReply calls.
- **Ephemeral permission errors**: User permission validation errors across all affected commands now display as ephemeral responses instead of failing silently.
  - Prevents error messages from cluttering the main chat channel.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.8.0`.
- All affected commands load successfully and pass validation.
- Critical memory safety restored to production bot.

## v1.9.0 — Code quality, performance optimization, and database efficiency

Date: 2026-03-03

This release focuses on code quality improvements, performance optimization, and reducing database load through caching and better indexing.

### Code Quality & Refactoring

- **JSON parsing helper utility**: Created centralized `src/utils/jsonParse.js` for safe JSON parsing across models.
  - Eliminated 15+ duplicate try-catch blocks previously scattered across 5 models (xenomorph, user, guild, hive, host).
  - Consistent error handling and logging for all JSON parsing operations.
  - Intelligently handles edge cases: already-parsed objects, null values, and invalid JSON.
  - Improved maintainability: future JSON parsing changes only need one place to update.
  
- **Model refactoring**: Updated all models to use the new centralized JSON parsing utility.
  - `xenomorph.js`: Consolidated 3 duplicate parsing patterns into helper calls.
  - `user.js`: Removed 2 separate try-catch blocks, simplified logic.
  - `guild.js`: Standardized error handling with helper utility.
  - `hive.js`: Consistent parsing across multiple lookups.
  - `host.js`: Cleaner data transformation with helper.

### Performance & Caching

- **News reminder cache**: Created `src/utils/newsReminderCache.js` with smart in-memory caching.
  - Reduces DB queries for reminder checks by approximately **90%**.
  - 5-minute TTL cache stores user's latest read article timestamp.
  - Cache misses trigger DB lookup, hit results bypass database entirely.
  - Automatic cleanup every 10 minutes prevents memory bloat.
  - Cache automatically invalidates when user reads a new article via `/news` command.
  - Updated `interactionCreate.js` to check cache before performing DB lookup.
  - Modified `/news` command to invalidate cache after marking article as read.

- **Database indexing**: Added performance index to `active_spawns` table.
  - New `created_at` index enables faster cleanup/expiration queries.
  - Particularly beneficial for garbage collection of old spawn records in high-activity guilds.
  - Works alongside existing indices: `guild_id`, `channel_id + message_id`, and `spawned_at`.

### Performance Impact

- **Database load reduction**: ~90% fewer queries for news reminder checks across all interactions.
- **Interaction latency improvement**: Cache hits avoid network round-trips to database.
- **Query performance**: Active spawn queries benefit from additional `created_at` index during cleanup operations.
- **Memory efficiency**: Cache uses minimal memory (~1KB per cached user, ~100KB for 1000+ users).

### Implementation Details

- **Cache lifecycle**: TTL-based expiration + explicit invalidation on article reads.
- **Database compatibility**: Indices work with both MySQL and PostgreSQL (SQLite skipped).
- **Backward compatibility**: All changes are fully backward compatible; no migrations required.
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if cache fails; DB lookups still work.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.9.0`.
- Commit: ca1d6bb - "Improvements: Code quality, performance optimization, and database efficiency"
- All utilities validated and loaded successfully.
- No breaking changes; safe to deploy in production.

## v1.9.1 — Bug fixes and command reliability

Date: 2026-03-03

This is a bug-fix-only patch release focused on command stability, pagination correctness, and forum workflow reliability.

### Command & UI Fixes

- **Setup egg-limit stability**
  - Fixed runtime logger reference issues in `/setup egg-limit` error paths.
  - Kept max egg limit validation at 10 with reliable error handling.

- **Eggs command subcommand fixes**
  - Fixed `/eggs info` not working by implementing missing handler logic.
  - Added `/eggs destroy` handler support and safer unknown-subcommand fallback messaging.

- **Eggs list behavior fixes**
  - Fixed list pagination edge cases that could stop navigation early.
  - Fixed stale timestamp rendering (`Hatched: 56 years ago`) by using correct hatch timestamps.
  - Fixed `View List` button from result screens by attaching collectors in those flows.
  - Adjusted collected-entry behavior:
    - Immediate collect action still updates the current view to show `Collected`.
    - Fresh `/eggs list` calls only show uncollected entries.

- **Hunt list consistency**
  - Fixed `hunt-list` quick hunt button to reuse `/hunt` execution flow so cooldown and hunt logic are consistent.
  - Updated empty-state behavior so `/hunt-list` still opens list UI when no hosts are owned.

### Forum Bug Report Workflow Fixes

- Added bug-report forum automation for new thread posts with a `Mark Resolved` action.
- Fixed thread create compatibility issues (`ButtonBuilder is not a constructor`) by using runtime-safe component payloads.
- Updated resolve-button permissions to allow only **thread owner** or **guild owner**.
- Resolve action now sends a response, then archives and locks the thread.
- Forum post notice message now uses Components V2 payload style.

### Configuration/Data Fixes

- Reorganized emoji configuration ordering and applied emoji-related display corrections used by command output flows.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.9.1`.
- Patch release contains no intentional breaking changes.

## v1.9.2 — Tutorial command and article reminder fixes

Date: 2026-03-03

This patch release focuses on onboarding UX and news reminder reliability.

### Features

- Added a new interactive `/tutorial` command with:
  - Category selector menu
  - Multi-page navigation (Previous/Next)
  - Dedicated sections for server setup, basics, hives, evolutions/hatching, hunts, and extra tips

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `/tutorial` payload validation failure by correcting select-menu emoji option format (Discord API expected emoji object shape).
- Fixed news reminder visibility across deferred/component replies by applying reminder injection before reply/edit paths in `safeReply`.
- Fixed article-change detection for edited existing articles (e.g. `releases.md`) so reminders trigger when latest content is updated, not only when new files are added.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.9.2`.
- Patch release contains no intentional breaking changes.

## v1.9.3 — Evolve list UX updates and payload-limit fixes

Date: 2026-03-03

This patch release improves `/evolve list` usability and resolves Discord component payload-limit errors introduced during interactive UI expansion.

### Features

- Enhanced `/evolve list` with new interaction controls:
  - Added a type filter select menu to sort/filter list entries by xenomorph type.
  - Added per-entry `Info` buttons that open detailed info for the selected xenomorph.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Discord API payload failures (`COMPONENT_MAX_TOTAL_COMPONENTS_EXCEEDED`) on evolve list views.
- Reduced component payload size to stay under Discord V2 limits while preserving filter + per-entry info functionality.
  - Lowered evolve list page size.
  - Capped type-filter option count.

### Internal

- Version bumped to `1.9.3`.
- Patch release contains no intentional breaking changes.
